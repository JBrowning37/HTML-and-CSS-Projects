# HTML-and-CSS-Projects

This has all of the code and projects from the HTML and CSS course.

There were two sample websites created using HTML and CSS.

# One Page Website

The goal for this project was to create a website that has everything on one page. I made this website as an example of a homepage for a tattoo artist. It features three main sections; A home/landing page, a gallery, and a contact form. All which can be quickly navigated to with the use of the nav bar. 

# Bootstrap4 Project

The goal for this project was to create a home page for a movie theater. It showcases and is styled using bootstrap4. It features the use of a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and a dropdown.
